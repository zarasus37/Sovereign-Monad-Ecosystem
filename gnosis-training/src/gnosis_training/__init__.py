"""TTCL Layer 7 Training Pipeline (SFT→Reward→GRPO→Eval).

Real TRL wiring (SFTTrainer / RewardTrainer / GRPOTrainer + QLoRA), import-smoke
verified. NO training is executed in this package by default — the LLaMA 3.1 8B
run is an explicitly-future GPU job. See README.md for the honesty posture.

This top-level import is intentionally LIGHT: it exposes only the CPU-pure
surface (config + event wire-shape + version) so that ``import gnosis_training``
succeeds on a CPU box without pulling torch / transformers / trl. The heavy
trainer modules (``gnosis_training.sft`` / ``.reward`` / ``.grpo``) are opt-in
and lazy-import their dependencies inside their builder functions.
